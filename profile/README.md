**tl;dr**: [commoditize](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Commodity#Commoditization) enterprise tools through open source to free up technical labor for higher priority consumer empowerment problems

branding weakens an economy

besides undermining the consumer intellect by training it to apply a name rather than a measure to product performance, valuable technical labor is wasted on reinventing the wheel behind every "brand" seeking to play catch up with some marginal improvement shipped by a competitor

"hey, an engineer at *mcdonalds* just deployed a feature that allows customers to schedule a table, order food, and pay for it before they arrive... build that for us too"

"hey, an engineer at *amazon* just deployed a feature that drops the price of an item after its inventory increases... build that for us too"

just as engineers dont wish to repeat code for "i want to [schedule applications](https://github.com/kubernetes/kubernetes) to run on servers at my business named X", they dont want to repeat code for  "i want to host an online menu for my fast food restaurant named Y" or "i want to operate an inventory management system for my retail business named Z"

since much larger problems in the economy deserve solving, engineers prefer not to occupy their time helping copycat executives play catch up with one another

nor are they interested in the company names used to give cover for this activity

engineers care about the tech

and unless they intend to compete with it, they prefer to build on rather than repeat it

to protect technical labor, avoid "brands" and the repetition they indulge

instead, invest technical labor in building up brick and mortar businesses that use publicly developed, competitively-priced supply chain management, resource planning and accounting solutions so trivial increases in technical advantage are shipped to the economy, and not subject to the information friction added by trade names

then publish the real time financial accounting of these businesses so youth can view them as high school [automation projects](https://github.com/mxfactorial/automation-solves-poverty) rather than some magical place where things are different because "brand"

clever marketing also wastes funds on persuading consumers of differences that dont exist

which indulges executives who pursue a career in producing information that adds almost zero physical value for consumers

engineers dont deal in fictional differences because its not an option
